# Leviathan

[Leviathan](http://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/) is the third challenge I undertook. It has less levels than Bandit or Natas, and is similar to Bandit in that it involves ssh'ing into a server.

The server for Leviathan is at `leviathan.labs.overthewire.org`, port `2223`, accessed over SSH. I have continued with markdown files for this challenge, as I used with Natas.
