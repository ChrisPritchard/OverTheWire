# Natas

[Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) is a beginner web-security challenge. It has, at time of writing, 32 levels (excluding 0, and with 33 being a 'Thankyou for Playing' message).

As web hacking is less scriptable, the challenge solutions were written in markdown writeups. When I needed to do some custom code to figure things out, I either used the same language as the challenge (e.g. PHP) or a custom F# script.
